# Smart-delivery-robot-AI
A Smart Delivery Robot simulation that navigates a user-defined grid with delivery points, obstacles, no-entry zones, and one-way streets. It uses the A* algorithm for pathfinding, visualizes the environment, and autonomously delivers parcels while avoiding restrictions. Developed for Artificial Intelligence coursework at university.
